  Add written explanation of your solution here
  As we iterate through the numbers in the array,
  we can create a new object as part of our algorithm 
  to keep track of all the numbers we've already seen 
  as keys on the object, so we can quickly check if the
   object has a key that we're looking for. Then, on the
    next iteration, we can see if one of the numbers we've 
    added as a key to our object is a complement to the number 
    we're iterating over (if it adds up to the target number).
